# CRAB

HI! This is the software needed to run CRAB remotley. Everything Labeled GHV232 is the glassman remotecontrol software which is not connected to the CRAB front panel on labview. You can totally run CRAB with just that software, but it does not have the BK precision controls on it. Eveyrhting labeled "BK Precision 91xx" is to control the small power supply. The full CRAB front panel I (JBR) designed is labeled "CRAB and II." This is the labVIEW software I made that can control all of the Glassmans needed for the El+, EL++ and field cage, as well as the BK precision power supply. In order for this front panel to work, all glassmans need to be connected to the computer via ethernet. You will have to use digi real port Device discovery, located in the glassman GHV drivers to 1) check the IP address and 2) configure such IP address.
